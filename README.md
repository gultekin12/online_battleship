Trying to build an online battleship 1v1 game using NodeJS

# First Time Install
In order to run the server in your local, you first need to install these: 
 - Node.JS (v10+)
 - yarn

When you have installed the required things, just run these commands:
 - `yarn install:backend`
 - `yarn install:backend`
 
## Running the server on local
To run the server for **development** on your local computer, open two terminals and run these commands:
 - `yarn dev:backend`
 - `yarn dev:frontend`
 
To run the server for **production** on a server, first build the client files using the first command and then serve them with backend using the second command and it should be ready to go:
 - `yarn start:frontend`
 - `yarn start:backend`
